# IAM Roles for services 
1 so services can thuc hien hanh dong tren chinh ban than no 
=> ta cap quyen de cho aws service thuc hien voi IAM services
common roles : EC2 instance Roles
lambda function roles
cloudFormation

# EC2:
Security groups 
roles
SSH

EC2 instances Purchasing ops
-on-demand <short workload, predictable pricing,pay per second
-reserved(!&3year) 
    reserved instances - long workload (upto 72% discount compared to on-demand)
    can sell in maketplace
    Convertible Reserved instances - long workload with flexible (66%)
-saving plan(1& 3 year) -commitment to an amount of usage,long workload (discount up to 72%)
-spot instances -short workload, cheap, can lose instance(less reliable)
    get 90 % but can lose if your max price is less then current spt price

EC2 Spot Instance Requests
can get a discount 90% 
spot fleet lowest cost

# High Availability & Scalability
Scalability: Thich ung tot hon khi app or system chay
Vertical Scalability: theo chieu doc/ tang size cua instances
Example: RDS . ..Ecache
-Horizontal Scalability: theo chieu ngang , tang number of instances,
    Example: web apps, modern apps...

HA = High Availability
run system / apps with least 2 data center 
goals is survice when data center loss

  # ELB = Elastic
  Have 4 types of LBC 
    2022 deprecated X - Classic Load Balancer - CLB  - HTTP,HTTPS,TCP,SSL
    - Application Load Balancer - ALB - HTTP/S, Websocket
    - network Load Balancer - NLB - TCP, TLS, update
    - Gateway Load Balancer -GWLB - Operates at layer 3 - IP protocol
    
# ALB is Layer 7 (HTTP)
Routing based on Path,hostname/URL, query String ,Headers
fit for micro Services, container based app
port Mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS 
 Direct traffic to health 
# Network Load Balancer 
 Forward TCP , UDP to instances
 handle milions request per seconds
 less latency ~100 (400ms for ALB)
Has one static IP per AZ  
Used for Extreme Performance, TCP, UDP

# Gateway Load Balancer 
Deploy,scale,manage fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances

# Cross Zone Load Blancing
luu luong truy cap chia deu cho all instance on all AZ
-With ALB
    enable by default
    No charges dor inter AZ data
    = neu muon chuyen data qua zone khac thi phai pay mopre , 
    = but ALB cross zone 
- NLB, GWLB
    Disabled by default 
    Pay CHarges for inter AZ date if enabled

# SSL/ TLS Ce - basics 
SNI= server name indication
suport mutil certificate for mutil domain
used for ALB NLB

# Connection Draining
Feature naming 
    Connection Draining - for CLB
    Deregistration Delay - for ALB& NLB

# ASG / auto Scaling group
    Scale out ( add EC2 Instances) to mactch a increased load
    Scale in (remove EC2 Instances) to match a decreased load
    have to mini and max instances
    auto create instance    
    Possible to scale based on CloudWatch alarms

# Amazon RDS Overview 
    RDS Relational Databases service
    manage DB service use SQL 
    postgres , mysql,mariaDB,...
    RDS - Storage Auto Scaling
RDS read replicas 
Use cases 
    You have a prooduction database that is taking on nomarl load 
    Network cost when data from one to another AZ
    Read replicas don't pay feature
    
# Am    azon Aurora
    Support for Postgress and Mysql
    Proprietary AWS
    x5 performance improve MYsql and 3x Posrgres on RDS
    Aurora storage auto grows in increments of 10GB -> 128TB
    upto 15replicas 
    6 repliacs 3 AZ different
    can make some enpoint to access < read and write >
Aurora replicas - auto Scaling
Aurora Serverless 
    Pay per second , can be more cost-effective
    No planning needed 
    Automation scaling based on actual usage
Global Aurora
    - Cross region read replicas 
    -global database 
        primary region , 
        5 secondary regions ,replication lag is less than 1 second
        16replicas per Secondary regions

RDS Backups 
    automated backups :
        dayly full backup
        transaction log backup by RDS  every 5 minutes
        ability to restore at any point in time (1>35 days retention) 0 to disable auto backups
    Manual DB Snapshots:
        triggered by user 
    *Trick:in stoped RDS database , will still pay for stage ,
    snapshot is free should use it for restore 

Aurora backups
     - automated backups
        1 >35 days ( cannot be disabled)
RDS / Aurora Restore options
    - RDS / Aurora Backup or Snapshot create a new DB
    - Mysql RDS from S3
        create a backup of your on-premises DB
        restore it on Amazon S3restore Backup file on new RDS instance
    - Mysql Aurora Cluster from S3
        create a backup your on-premises DB using Percona XtraBackup
        store file on AmazonS3
        restore on New Aurora cluster running Mysql

# Amazon RDS Proxy

# Route 53 
 -DNS terminologies 
    DOmain REgistrar : Amazon route 53, GoDaddy...
    DNS Records: A,AAA,
    zone file: contains DNS Records
    Name Server 
    Top lv Domain <TLD> .com...
    Second lv domain <SLD> asdad.com

- highly avaiable , Scanable, fully managed ,Authoritative = can update DNS Records

Route 53- Records TTL ( Time to Live)

# CNAME vs Alias 
AWS Resources (Load Blancer,Cloudfront...) expose an AWS hostname

CNAME : Point a hostname to any other Hostname
Alias: 

routing Policies - 
    -simple
    can use mutil values in same record => random choose one
     when alias enable only AWS Resources

     can't be associate eith Health checks
    - Latency based
    -failover , 
    -Geolocation
    -geoproximity
    -IP-based
    -mutil values
# Amazon S3 
     Is manin building blocks of AWS
     is a key 
     bucket = object + file name

Amazon S3 -Security
    IAM allow permission

AmazonS3 - Static Website Hosting 
Amazon S3 - replication (CRR & SRR)
    cross region rep / Same Region rep

S3 Storage Classes 

    -

S3 - Object Encryption
    -Server-side Encryption (SSE)
